// Create a new screen object and associate it with a logical name and a
// number.  This number is used as an index to retrieve the AWT GraphicsDevice
// from the array that GraphicsEnvironment.getScreenDevices() returns.

// NOTE: The GraphicsDevice order in the array is specific to the local
// site and display system.
// 
(NewScreen center 0)

// Create a fullscreen window
//
(ScreenAttribute center WindowSize NoBorderFullScreen)

// Set the available image area for the full screen.  This is important when an
// explicit ScreenScale view attribute is defined for precise scaling between
// objects in the virtual world and their projections into the physical world.
// The defaults are 0.365 meters for width and 0.292 meters for height.
// 
(ScreenAttribute center	PhysicalScreenWidth  0.360)
(ScreenAttribute center	PhysicalScreenHeight 0.288)

// Set the TrackerBaseToImagePlate transform for this screen.  The coexistence
// to tracker base transform is identity by default, so the tracker base origin
// and orientation will also set the origin and orientation of coexistence
// coordinates in the physical world.  This is the primary purpose of setting
// this transform when neither head tracking nor multiple screens are being
// used. 
//
// The tracker base and center of coexistence are set here to the middle of the
// screen's image plate.  Their basis vectors are aligned with the image plate
// basis vectors.  The physical eyepoint position will be set relative to
// coexistence coordinates below.
